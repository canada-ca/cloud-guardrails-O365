# Enable Logging and Monitoring

## Objective

Continuously monitor system events and performance and include a security audit log function in all information systems to enable the detection of incidents. It is essential that an adequate level of logging and reporting including a security audit log function in all information systems hosted in the cloud environment and for cloud-based workloads.

## Key Considerations

### Logging

* [ ] Ensure mailbox auditing for all users is Enabled
* [ ] Ensure Microsoft 365 audit log search is Enabled
* [ ] Leverage [Office 365 Management Activity API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference) to retrieve information about user, admin, system, and policy actions and events from Office 365 and Azure AD activity logs
* [ ] Identify the events within the solution that must be audited in accordance with [GC Event Logging](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/e/e3/GC_Event_Logging_Strategy.pdf)
* [ ] Configure the service to send audit log records to a centralized logging facility, if one is available

### Monitoring

* [ ] Continuously monitor system events and performance. Ensure reports are reviewed at least weekly including:
  * Access reports for all administrative accounts
  * Azure AD 'Risky sign-ins' report
  * User role group changes
  * Account Provisioning Activity report
  * non-global administrator role group assignments
  * Self-service password reset activity report
  * DLP policy matches report
  * DLP incidents report
  * DLP false positives and overrides report
* [ ] Configure alerts and notifications to be sent to the appropriate contact/team in the organization.
* [ ] Configure or use an authoritative time source for the time-stamp of the audit records generated by your solution components.
* [ ] Develop a plan to respond to and understand the impact of security incidents, in accordance with the [GC Cyber Security Event Management Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/security-identity-management/government-canada-cyber-security-event-management-plan.html)
* [ ] Establish an MOU for defensive services and threat monitoring protection services with CCCS

## Additional Considerations

* [ ] The use of a central logging solution should be considered whenever and wherever possible. Capabilities that automate event and behaviour analysis, and offer real-time alerting can help to identify possible security threats and incidents.

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm policy for event logging is implemented.
* [ ] Confirm event logs are being generated.
* [ ] Confirm that security contact information has been configured to receive alerts and notifications.
* [ ] Confirm that there is a plan in place to respond to incidents.
