# Enable Logging and Monitoring

## Objective

Continuously monitoring system events and performance, and including a security audit log function in all information systems, enables the detection of incidents in support of continued delivery of services. It is essential that an adequate level of logging and reporting is configured for the cloud environment and for cloud-based workloads.

## Key Considerations

### Logging

* [ ] Implement adequate level of logging and reporting, including a security audit log function in all information systems.
* [ ] Ensure mailbox auditing for all users is Enabled
* [ ] Ensure Microsoft 365 audit log search is Enabled
* [ ] Leverage Office 365 Management Activity API to retrieve information about user, admin, system, and policy actions and events from Office 365 and Azure AD activity logs. More details are available at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference>
* [ ] Identify the events within the solution that must be audited in accordance with [GC Event Logging](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/e/e3/GC_Event_Logging_Strategy.pdf).

### Monitoring

* [ ] Ensure reports are reviewed at least weekly

**Note:** You may need to configure your solution to send the audit log records to a centralized logging facility, if one is available, where existing auditing mechanisms will be applied.

* [ ] Configure alerts and notifications to be sent to the appropriate contact/team in the organization.
* [ ] Configure or use an authoritative time source for the time-stamp of the audit records generated by your solution components.
* [ ] Continuously monitor system events and performance.
* [ ] Develop a plan to respond to and understand the impact of security incidents, in accordance with the [GC Cyber Security Event Management Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/security-identity-management/government-canada-cyber-security-event-management-plan.html)
* [ ] Establish an MOU for defensive services and threat monitoring protection services with CCCS

## Additional Considerations

* [ ] The use of a central logging solution should be considered whenever and wherever possible. Capabilities that automate event and behaviour analysis, and offer real-time alerting can help to identify possible security threats and incidents.  

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm policy for event logging is implemented.
* [ ] Confirm event logs are being generated.
* [ ] Confirm that security contact information has been configured to receive alerts and notifications.
* [ ] Confirm that there is a plan in place to respond to incidents.
