# Validate Settings

## Objective

Use built-in tools to validate the security configuration and settings for O365 and apply recommendations as appropriate to improve security posture. Ensure that there is a consistent level of protection across GC data, identities, and devices.

## Key Considerations

* Validate that the recommended [identity and device access configurations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-policies-configurations?view=o365-worldwide) have been implemented
* Use Microsoft Secure Score to measure the current state of the O365 configuration and security posture. A higher number indicates that more improvement actions need to be taken.
* Compare current state posture with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs)

## Validation

* TBD
